Frame: Frames changes from top left to bottom right of the screen. While the screen is printing the current frame on the screen, another frame is creating on the background. When the screen finished drawing the current frame it switcs to the next frame. And so on.

Back Buffer: Frame processing on the background or waiting for replacement of the current/front buffer is the back buffer. Voila
